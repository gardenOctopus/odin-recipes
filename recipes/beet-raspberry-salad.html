        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This raspberry beet salad recipe was designed to be versatile and budget-friendly. It requires few ingredients, and you can easily swap out the raspberries for strawberries or blueberries, and use whatever type of jam you want. The balsamic glaze can be swapped for balsamic vinegar. You can also add mint leaves.

            You can probably tell what kind of cook I am from the above paragraph. It’s very hard for me to create recipes because I tend to change things constantly. I am not much of a cook, and I don’t usually make my own recipes, but I liked this recipe well enough to keep making it (in different ways).
