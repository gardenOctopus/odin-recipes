        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>I started making this recipe in college. At the time, I thought that adding berries or fruit to a lettuce salad was a novel idea, but now I know that this is very common.</p>
        <p>This is a pretty versatile recipe. The spinach can be replaced with a spring salad mix or arugula, and berries can be added to it as well. </p>
