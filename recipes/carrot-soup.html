        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve been making this carrot soup recipe since I was in college, so it’s a nostalgic recipe for me.  It’s a great recipe for autumn, winter, or when you’re trying to use us the remaining carrots in your fridge.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s a fairly simple recipe to follow, as it only has four steps. It is also budget-friendly if you already have the spices on hand. The potato is optional, you can make this recipe without it.
